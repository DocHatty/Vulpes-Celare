# 🎯 VULPES CORTEX - QUICK START

## ✅ Setup Complete

Your MCP server is configured and ready. 

## 🚀 To Activate:

1. **Close Claude Desktop completely**
2. **Reopen Claude Desktop**
3. Done! The vulpes-cortex server starts automatically

## ✅ To Verify It's Working:

Ask me in chat:
```
What MCP servers are connected?
```

You should see **vulpes-cortex** in the list.

## 🎮 Example Commands:

Try any of these:

```
Run a quick test on Vulpes Celare
```

```
What should I improve next in my PHI detection?
```

```
Analyze patterns in recent test failures
```

```
Show me the current codebase state
```

```
Consult history about SSN filter improvements
```

```
What's the trend in sensitivity over the last 30 days?
```

## 🧠 What Happens:

Claude automatically:
1. Runs your test suite **internally** (no spawning external processes)
2. Analyzes results with pattern recognition
3. Consults your historical data (what worked/failed before)
4. Generates evidence-based recommendations
5. Tracks all interventions and their effects

## 📊 What You Get:

Every test run returns:
- **Grade** (A/B/C/D/F based on HIPAA_STRICT profile)
- **Metrics** (Sensitivity, Specificity, F1, MCC)
- **Top Failure** with examples and file to edit
- **Historical Context** (similar attempts, warnings)
- **Action** (specific one-liner: what to do next)
- **All Failures** grouped by PHI type
