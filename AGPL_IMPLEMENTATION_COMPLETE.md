## 🔑 Key Changes

### What Stayed the Same:

✅ **You own all the code** - No change to copyright  
✅ **Free for researchers** - Still completely free  
✅ **Free for education** - Still completely free  
✅ **Free for non-profits** - Still completely free  

### What Changed:

🔄 **Now truly open source** - AGPL-3.0 is OSI-approved  
🔄 **Anyone can fork** - No permission needed  
🔄 **Clear threshold** - $1M revenue (was vague "commercial use")  
🔄 **Startups can use freely** - < $1M revenue = no license needed  
🔄 **Community can contribute** - With CLA sign-off  

### What's Protected:

🛡️ **SaaS loophole closed** - AGPL requires source sharing for network services  
🛡️ **AWS can't steal it** - Must open source OR buy license  
🛡️ **Epic/Cerner must pay** - If bundling in proprietary EMR  
🛡️ **Modifications shared** - Community benefits from improvements
