## Why Dual Licensing?

We believe in open source AND sustainability:
- **Open source**: Code is auditable (critical for HIPAA PHI handling)
- **Free for small orgs**: Startups, researchers, non-profits benefit freely
- **Paid for large orgs**: Enterprise pays for closed-source use (funds development)

This model ensures the project remains:
- 🔓 Transparent and auditable
- 🚀 Well-maintained and improved
- 💰 Sustainable long-term
- 🤝 Fair to all users
