# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep Vulpes Celare safe for everyone. We appreciate responsible disclosures and will work with you to verify and address issues quickly.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied to the most recent released version. If you are using an older release, please upgrade before requesting a fix.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- **Email**: security@vulpescelare.org
- **What to include**: A clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any relevant logs or screenshots. Please avoid sharing real PHI or other sensitive data in reports.
- **Response expectations**: We will acknowledge receipt within **5 business days**. After validation, we will provide a remediation plan and expected timeline. If the issue is severe, we may request a coordinated disclosure timeline.

## Handling Sensitive Data

Because this project is focused on PHI redaction, we prefer minimal sample data. When demonstrating issues:

- Use synthetic or heavily anonymized text only.
- Do not include patient names, identifiers, or any PHI in issue attachments.
- If reproducing requires special datasets, coordinate privately by email first.

## Preferred Communication Channels

Use GitHub issues for general bugs and feature requests. Only use the security email for vulnerability disclosures or potentially exploitable behaviors.

## GPG Key

If you need encrypted communication, request the current public key when you email us.
